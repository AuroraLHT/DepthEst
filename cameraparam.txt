calib_cam_to_cam.txt: Camera-to-camera calibration
--------------------------------------------------

  - S_xx: 1x2 size of image xx before rectification
  - K_xx: 3x3 calibration matrix of camera xx before rectification
  - D_xx: 1x5 distortion vector of camera xx before rectification
  - R_xx: 3x3 rotation matrix of camera xx (extrinsic)
  - T_xx: 3x1 translation vector of camera xx (extrinsic)
  - S_rect_xx: 1x2 size of image xx after rectification
  - R_rect_xx: 3x3 rectifying rotation to make image planes co-planar
  - P_rect_xx: 3x4 projection matrix after rectification

Note: When using this dataset you will most likely need to access only
P_rect_xx, as this matrix is valid for the rectified image sequences.

This file contains the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera which are stored in "P_rect_xx".

from the opencv forum, the answer shows the Projection Rectification Matrix(P_rect_xx) contains the focal length of each axis(fx, fy) and the principal point of each axis(cx, cy)

The forum points ous to 3. --> http://docs.ros.org/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/CameraInfo.html

this page shows the composition of P and well explains it.

# Projection/camera matrix
#     [fx'  0  cx' Tx]
# P = [ 0  fy' cy' Ty]
#     [ 0   0   1   0]

# By convention, this matrix specifies the intrinsic (camera) matrix
#  of the processed (rectified) image. That is, the left 3x3 portion
#  is the normal camera intrinsic matrix for the rectified image.
# It projects 3D points in the camera coordinate frame to 2D pixel
#  coordinates using the focal lengths (fx', fy') and principal point
#  (cx', cy') - these may differ from the values in K.
# For monocular cameras, Tx = Ty = 0. Normally, monocular cameras will
#  also have R = the identity and P[1:3,1:3] = K.
# For a stereo pair, the fourth column [Tx Ty 0]' is related to the
#  position of the optical center of the second camera in the first
#  camera's frame. We assume Tz = 0 so both cameras are in the same
#  stereo image plane. The first camera always has Tx = Ty = 0. For
#  the right (second) camera of a horizontal stereo pair, Ty = 0 and
#  Tx = -fx' * B, where B is the baseline between the cameras.
# Given a 3D point [X Y Z]', the projection (x, y) of the point onto
#  the rectified image is given by:
#  [u v w]' = P * [X Y Z 1]'
#         x = u / w
#         y = v / w
#  This holds for both images of a stereo pair.
